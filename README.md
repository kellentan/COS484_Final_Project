# COS484_Final_Project
This repository contains the code needed to replicate our experiments for our final project in COS 484 (Spring 2024 semester) at Princeton University. The objective of our project was to replicate and extend the original paper "Birds have four legs?! NumerSense: Probing Numerical Commonsense Knowledge of Pre-Trained Language Models."

N.B. Code & instructions for how to run to come!
